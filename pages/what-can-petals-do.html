    <h1>What Can Petals Do?</h1>
    <h5>Dec. 2019 / Personal Project</h5>
    <p> <i>What Can Petals Do?</i>  is a projection mapping installation that invite audiences to touch the ritual settings.  By sitting in front of the table, and interact with the placemat naturally, the audience might realized that even the smallest part of a creature can have large impacts to our lives.</p>
    <p>This is a <strong>personal project</strong> . I made the projection mapping, soft circuit, and animations.</p>

      In this work, I tried to discuss the power of small creatures, and how it can be embedded in our daily ritual. I put a placemat on the table, then project animations on it. Audiences can touch 4 different petals. Each one would reveal a detailed mini story of what can a petal do. By sitting in front of the table, and interact with the placemat naturally, people might realized that even the smallest part of a creature can have large impacts to our lives. This setting can be installed in any room with a space on a table.

    <p>
      I connected conductive fabric with Makey Makey to control the computer's keyboard, which allows audiences interact with the piece. The keyboard can control the MadMapper (Projection Mapping software)to play each scenes that I created for the work. The projector was installed on the wall, right above the whole table setting, so the audience wouldn't notice the trick.
