    <h1>Game: TOTO</h1>
    <h5>Oct. 2018 - Dec. 2018 / Personal Project</h5>
    <p> The game is about the player finding an impossible creature in 2050 and trying to protect it from the dangerous environment, by collecting and recycling the plastic waste and turning it into precious resources and even a device to help the creature. The final device doesn't have to be practical, but needs to solve problems in a creative way.</p>
    <p>This is a <strong>personal project</strong> . I designed the storytelling, all the arts, and also developed the game in p5.js.</p>

    <h2>Demo Video</h2>

    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>

    <p>We often hear about the importance of protecting the environment. However, only a few people take further actions. Thus, my final project is trying to discuss the way of motivating people to care more about environmental problems.</p>

    <p>To narrow down the topic, I chose the problem of plastic reducing and recycling. After analyzing the existing ways of promoting and educating people about plastic pollution, I found out that they often use negative information to scare or threaten people. So I was wondering: if I could make something positive and fun would this motivate people more to care about and act on recycling?</p>

    <h2>DESIGN STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>I want to build a <b>game </b>that can motivate people to care more about <b>plastic pollution</b> in a <b>positive way</b>.</p>

    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>

    <h3>Precedent</h3>
    <p>Through the recommendation of my professor, I participated in an event held by <a href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/workspaces.html">Precious Plastics</a>. This community shared much free knowledge which was intended to allow the public to build their machines for recycling plastics and making new products.</p>

    <h3>Survey</h3>
    <p>I decided to use research and interviews to let users choose which ones sound to make them motivated and which sounds more interesting. My goal is to choose the most interesting and motivating 1-2 of the games as the theme of the game, and recognise the content that users think is tedious but essential, and strive to make them interesting and positive in the future.</p>
    <img src="../image/toto/survey.png" alt="">
    <p>The method is that I have listed nine representative statements about plastics. Then print them on a small card. They are then asked to classify the cards into four quadrants. </p>
    <img src="../image/toto/result.png" alt="">
    <p>In the end, I chose Marine Creature and Creating by Yourself as my game theme. Recycling is also essential, so I hope to integrate them in the game.</p>

    <h2>STORYBOARD</h2>
    <h3>Scene one: the dream of the impossible creature.</h3>

    <h3>Scene two: finding the sea turtle.</h3>

    <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
    <p>Scene one and Scene two are combining animation and conversations.</p>
    <h3>Scene three: defeating the huge plastic monster and collecting materials.</h3>

    <h3>Scene four: designing your own creative machine to help the baby sea turtle survive. </h3>

    <h3>Key Value</h3>

    <h2>USER TEST</h2>
    <p>This user test is used to determine the final form of the creative making process. However,
what kind of game mechanism could be used to motivate players to collect plastic and applied
materials? This is the problem needs to be solved.</p>
    <img src="../image/toto/user-test.png" alt="">

  <img src="../image/toto/shapes.png" alt="">
  <p>I was wondering if I could combine these two ways of creating, with some degrees of
freedom, but also easy to express thoughts. In that case, it can simulate the use of plastic to make
things, which is similar to Precious Plastic and recycled plastic 3D printing.</p>

  <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
  <h3>Code</h3>
  <p>I used P5.JS to develop my game. I also used the library “p5.play” to achieve my goal as
building a game on a website. Moreover, for now, the project is still in progress.</p>
