    <h1>BABiES</h1>
    <h5>May. 2016 - JUN. 2016 / Group Project</h5>
    <p>BABiES is a intelligent nursery system for babies and parents, including hardware facilities and software support. We hope that this system can give nursery room in China a new possible solution, and solve real problems in the parenting process as well. I played the role of the leader, UX designer in the team.</p>
    <p>I'm the <strong>group leader, researcher</strong> and <strong>UX designer</strong> in this project.</p>

    <h2>IMPORTANCE</h2>

    <p>
      Young mothers might feel embarrass when breast-feed in public, so some mothers bring bottles, or simply just limit breastfeeding space. They prefer not to go outside or even never go outside, even if they have to go outside ,just go out in a hurry. Many mothers feel helpless for the the lack of parent rooms.

    <p>
      Parenting room is not simply a room with a bed, but a room meeting diverse needs of mothers, supporting perfect basic infrastructure and guaranteed service. At the same time ,develop management system, clear responsibilities, improve service, avoid to be a white elephant, so that mothers have the dignity, safety and reassurance to exercise their mothers' rights.
    </p>


    <h2>PROBLEMS IN CHINA</h2>
    <p>
      The institution Babytree in China has made an investigation of one hundred and fifty thousand family about the parent room, the result shows that only 11.3% of the company provides nursery rooms for mothers. And the higher level the city is, the better situation it gets.
    </p>
    <p>At present, not private and incomplete internal hardware facilities become the main problems of most parent rooms in China. Also, the majority of parent rooms are poor in sanitary conditions ,not comfortable, even everybody can enter, and the area is too small.</p>
    <p>The survey also collected the needs of mothers for the location of the nursery. 63.5% mothers were most expected to set up public parent rooms in the mall, Then the park and the street with 54.9% and 39.6% .</p>

    <p>As a result, there is still a lot of room for development and improvement of parent room inChina , and there is a growing demand of it. So I chose this theme, and want to offer a possible solution to improve this situation.</p>

    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
    <p>
      These were three shopping malls I chose, which are the center of children shopping as well as having nursery rooms. I found some reviews about the nursery rooms on the internet. And then I sorted out the data.
